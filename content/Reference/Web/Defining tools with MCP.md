In this example, we're creating an MCP server that manages documents stored in memory. The server will provide two essential tools: one to read document contents and another to update them through find-and-replace operations.

## Setting Up the MCP Server

The Python MCP SDK makes server creation incredibly straightforward. You can initialize a complete MCP server with just one line:

```
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("DocumentMCP", log_level="ERROR")
```

For this implementation, documents are stored in a simple Python dictionary where keys are document IDs and values contain the document content:

```
docs = {
    "deposition.md": "This deposition covers the testimony of Angela Smith, P.E.",
    "report.pdf": "The report details the state of a 20m condenser tower.",
    "financials.docx": "These financials outline the project's budget and expenditure",
    "outlook.pdf": "This document presents the projected future performance of the",
    "plan.md": "The plan outlines the steps for the project's implementation.",
    "spec.txt": "These specifications define the technical requirements for the equipment"
}
```

## Tool Definition with Decorators

The SDK transforms tool creation from a verbose process into something clean and readable. Instead of writing lengthy JSON schemas, you use Python decorators and type hints.

## Creating the Document Reader Tool

The first tool allows Claude to read any document by its ID. Here's the complete implementation:

```
@mcp.tool(
    name="read_doc_contents",
    description="Read the contents of a document and return it as a string."
)
def read_document(
    doc_id: str = Field(description="Id of the document to read")
):
    if doc_id not in docs:
        raise ValueError(f"Doc with id {doc_id} not found")
    
    return docs[doc_id]
```

The `@mcp.tool` decorator automatically generates the JSON schema that Claude needs. The `Field` class from Pydantic provides parameter descriptions that help Claude understand what each argument expects.

## Building the Document Editor Tool

The second tool performs simple find-and-replace operations on documents:

```
@mcp.tool(
    name="edit_document",
    description="Edit a document by replacing a string in the documents content with a new string."
)
def edit_document(
    doc_id: str = Field(description="Id of the document that will be edited"),
    old_str: str = Field(description="The text to replace. Must match exactly, including whitespace."),
    new_str: str = Field(description="The new text to insert in place of the old text.")
):
    if doc_id not in docs:
        raise ValueError(f"Doc with id {doc_id} not found")
    
    docs[doc_id] = docs[doc_id].replace(old_str, new_str)
```

This tool takes three parameters: the document ID, the text to find, and the replacement text. The implementation uses Python's built-in string `replace()` method for simplicity.

## Error Handling

Both tools include basic error handling to manage cases where Claude requests a document that doesn't exist. When an invalid document ID is provided, the tools raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message that Claude can understand and potentially act upon.

## Key Benefits of the SDK Approach

- Automatic JSON schema generation from Python type hints
- Clean, readable code that's easy to maintain
- Built-in parameter validation through Pydantic
- Reduced boilerplate compared to manual schema writing
- Type safety and IDE support for development

The MCP Python SDK transforms what used to be a complex process of writing tool definitions into something that feels natural for Python developers. You focus on the business logic while the SDK handles the protocol details.
